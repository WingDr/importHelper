Purpose

To parse and convert wiki links into standard markdown links for easy import.
How to use

After installation, an icon will be added to the top bar. Clicking on it will bring up a folder selection box. Select the folder you want to parse.
Precautions

It should support aliases and titles, etc.

After the parsing is completed, a folder ending with the source folder name plus 'prepared' will be added to the same level directory of the original folder.

Each file processing will generate a .log.md file.

To avoid mis-import, the result file will not be automatically imported after parsing is completed.
