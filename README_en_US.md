Purpose

Parse and convert wiki links to standard markdown links for easy import.
How to Use

After installation, an additional icon will appear on the top bar. Clicking on it will bring up a folder selection box. Select the folder you want to parse.
Precautions

It should support aliases and titles, etc.

Please note that the scope of link parsing only includes the folder you selected. Be aware of the storage location of resource files when selecting.

After parsing, a folder ending with 'prepared' will be added to the same level directory as the original folder, named after the source folder.

Each file processing will generate a .log.md file.

To avoid misimport, the result file will not be automatically imported after parsing.

## Thanks

Use fast-glob to traverse the markdown folder.
